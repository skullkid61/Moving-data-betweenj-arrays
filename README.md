# My test project

In this project I've been practising using the command line in VSCode to create files and commit changes to my github account.

Using [makeareadme.com](https//makeareadme.com) I've looked at best practice for creating markdown files

## Notes about test

In this project I'm practising moving the results of one array to a new array based on wheter the array items match an input from the user. This is to solve the problem of appending student results in another project. The idea is that rather than change whether the student results display on the page or are hidden, to change the data in the array first and then append the results. This means that it's not pulling in all the data onto the page and then hiding it, it's actually not pulling the info in the first place if it's not relevant.
